This is a project testing my skills that I have learned in the HTML foundations lessons on The Odin Project. 

I will have demonstrated that I know how to use boilerplates, elements, tags, lists, and images in HTML. 

This project will also demonstrate that I understand the importance of committing messages to GitHub as I work on my project.
